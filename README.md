## What's this for?

This package helps enforce some commit-message hygiene by prompting developers to start their commit messages with an emoji.

Prerequisites:

- 🐶husky

How to setup (V2):

- Install husky and run `yarn husky install`
- `yarn add emoji-commit-message-validator`
- `yarn emoji-check-install` (generates a `commit-msg` git hook)
